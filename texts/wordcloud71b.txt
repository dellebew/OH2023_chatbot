When I was young, I was told to study hard
To get into a good school, and have a successful career
But now I realize that there's more to life than just winning
Humanities teaches us to be compassionate and understanding
It helps us see the world from different perspectives
And appreciate the beauty in art and literature

Humanities is not just about learning dates and facts
It's about understanding the human condition
And finding ways to make our world a better place
So let's celebrate the humanities today
And appreciate all that it has to offer!
