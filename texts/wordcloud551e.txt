Design thinking is a process
It helps you to find the best solution
In a efficient and effective way

It is a human-centered approach
That always puts people first
It is a creative process
That helps you to think outside the box

It is a collaborative process
That brings people together
To solve problems in a creative way

Engineering is the application of science
It is about finding the best way to do things
In a safe and efficient way

 Engineering is about solving problems
It is about making things work
In the best way possible

Design thinking and engineering
Are two complementary disciplines
That help us to find the best solutions
For the problems we face in our lives
