The benefits of Humanities,

Science, design thinking

Are many and varied,

And they all contribute

To making our world a better place.

Humanities help us to understand

The past and present,

And to make sense of the world around us.

Science gives us the tools

To solve problems and to innovate,

And design thinking helps us

To create solutions that are both creative and practical.

All of these disciplines

Play a vital role

In making our world a better place.
