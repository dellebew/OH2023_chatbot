The benefits of Humanities,

Design thinking, and Technologies

Are many and varied,

And they all contribute to our understanding

Of the world around us.

Humanities help us to understand ourselves and others,

Design thinking allows us to create new things,

And technologies give us the tools

To make our lives easier and more efficient.
